title:  "Getting a Job as a Developer Without a Degree"
---

If you want to become a developer to start a new career or build an app, you can do it.
Just like any other skill, you have to put in the time and work.
Here are the reasons I was able to get a job as a software developer without a degree:

* demand of developers in the job market
* tools that made it easier to build
* access to free high quality learning resources 

##### Job Market

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics the number of software developer jobs is projected to increase by 24% from 2016 to 2026. This is much faster than other jobs as the average is <sup><a href="#[1]">[1]</a></sup>. Last but not least, automating a software developer's job is extremely difficult because problem solving and creativity plays a critical role.

##### Tools

In the past few years new programming languages, frameworks, tools, and products have increased productivity and lowered the barrier of entry for people to start building and creating value. For example the programming language, Ruby, caters towards developer productivity and happiness and allows you to solve the problem at hand. Pair that with Ruby on Rails (web framework built with Ruby) and the libraries the community has built, you can get a minimum viable product up and running in a matter of days. And this is just one language for one field (web apps). This can be applied to different fields (video games, mobile apps, machine learning).

The cost to distribute your work is also very low. For mobile apps you have app stores, for the web you have many cloud hosts (AWS, Render, GCP, Azure, etc.).
