title:  "Getting a Job as a Developer Without a Degree"
---

If you want to become a developer to start a new career or build something, **you can do it**.
You just have to put in the time and work.
I believe there were a few reasons I was to get a job as a software developer without a degree, that still applies today:

* demand of developers in the job market
* tools that made it easier to build
* access to free high quality learning resources
